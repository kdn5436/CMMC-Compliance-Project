# CMMC-Compliance-Project
This is the repository for the CMMC Compliance Project.  It will host the
network documents, Ansible scripts, and references required to build the test
environment.

The project consists of building three separate virtualized networks.  Each
network will comply with a certain level of the framework.  The levels in scope
for the project are 0, 1, and 2.  Level 3 may be accomplished if time and
experience allow.

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification 2.0 is a Department of
Defense (DoD) framework for information security in government contractor and
subcontractor businesses.  The CMMC 2.0 is broken up into four levels of
compliance:  
- Level 0: Non compliant
- Level 1. Foundational
- Level 2. Advanced
- Level 3. Expert
