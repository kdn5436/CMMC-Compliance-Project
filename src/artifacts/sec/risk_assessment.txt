**Risk Assessment Report # 26**
DATE: 12/12/2023 21:36:42

**Executive Summary:**

This risk assessment is based on the recent vulnerability scan results of our company's IT infrastructure, which includes a Windows 10 machine running an older version of Office 365 and an Ubuntu machine with MySQL 8. The presence of Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within our database systems heightens the need for stringent security measures. Given that some workstations have the capability to make changes to the database machines, the potential impact of a security breach could be significant.

**Identified Risks:**

1. **Risk of Remote Code Execution on Windows 10 Machine (CVE-2021-XYZ123):**
   - **Likelihood:** High - Due to the machine running an outdated version of Office 365.
   - **Impact:** High - Compromise of this machine could lead to unauthorized access to FCI/CUI, data manipulation, or further network infiltration.
   - **Risk Level:** High

2. **Risk of Exploitation due to Outdated Windows 10 Version (CVE-2020-ABC456):**
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - Older OS versions are more likely to be targeted as they may not have the latest security features.
   - **Impact:** Medium - An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access to the system and potentially the database.
   - **Risk Level:** Medium

3. **Risk of Privilege Escalation on Ubuntu Machine with MySQL (CVE-2022-XYZ789):**
   - **Likelihood:** High - The presence of a critical vulnerability in the MySQL server.
   - **Impact:** High - An attacker could gain unauthorized elevated privileges, leading to full control over the database containing FCI/CUI.
   - **Risk Level:** High

4. **Risk of Package Manager Vulnerability on Ubuntu Machine (CVE-2023-ABC123):**
   - **Likelihood:** Low - This type of vulnerability is generally well-managed through regular updates.
   - **Impact:** Low - Exploitation could lead to compromised system integrity but is less likely to directly affect the database.
   - **Risk Level:** Low

**Potential Business Impacts:**

- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to FCI/CUI could result in a data breach with legal and financial repercussions.
- **Reputation Damage:** Loss of stakeholder trust and damage to the company's reputation.
- **Operational Disruption:** A successful attack could disrupt business operations, leading to downtime and loss of productivity.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Non-compliance with federal regulations for handling FCI/CUI could lead to fines and loss of contracts.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Remediation of Identified Vulnerabilities:**
   - Prioritize the update of the Windows 10 machine and Office 365 to the latest versions.
   - Apply the security patch to the MySQL server on the Ubuntu machine.
   - Perform regular system updates on the Ubuntu machine to mitigate package manager vulnerabilities.

2. **Enhanced Access Controls:**
   - Implement strict access controls to limit which workstations can make changes to the database machines.
   - Employ the principle of least privilege to minimize the potential impact of a compromised workstation.

3. **Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response Plan:**
   - Establish continuous monitoring to detect and respond to threats in real-time.
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for scenarios involving FCI/CUI.

4. **Regular Security Training:**
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees to prevent accidental or intentional misuse of systems.

5. **Periodic Security Audits:**
   - Schedule regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities proactively.

**Conclusion:**

The vulnerabilities identified in the scan results pose a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the company's FCI and CUI. Immediate action is required to mitigate these risks and protect the company's assets and reputation.
