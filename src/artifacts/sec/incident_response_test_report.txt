INCIDENT RESPONSE TEST REPORT
--------------------------------------
Incident Report ID: IR-2023-04-02-001
Date of Incident: 2023-04-02
Date of Report: 2023-04-03
Incident Response Team Lead: Jane Doe

--------------------------------------
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

On April 2, 2023, our monitoring systems detected suspicious activity on two machines within our network: a Windows 10 machine running an older version of Office 365 and an Ubuntu machine with MySQL 8. The incident response team was activated and conducted a simulated response to contain and investigate the incident. This report outlines the key findings, actions taken, and recommendations for future prevention.

--------------------------------------
INCIDENT DETAILS:

Affected Systems:
1. Windows 10 Machine (win10-office)
   - IP Address: 192.168.1.10

2. Ubuntu Machine (ubuntu-mysql)
   - IP Address: 192.168.1.20

Type of Incident: Unauthorized access and data exfiltration

Initial Attack Vector:
- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 365 (CVE-2021-XYZ123) and MySQL Server (CVE-2022-XYZ789).

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):
- Unusual outbound network traffic
- Unexpected system processes running
- Unauthorized database queries on MySQL server
- Suspicious files found in the Office 365 installation directory

--------------------------------------
RESPONSE ACTIONS:

1. Incident Detection:
   - Monitoring systems flagged unusual activity, triggering an alert.
   - Security team initiated the incident response protocol.

2. Containment:
   - Network access for the affected machines was temporarily blocked.
   - User accounts with abnormal activity were disabled.

3. Eradication:
   - Malicious processes were terminated.
   - Malicious files were removed from the systems.

4. Recovery:
   - Systems were patched with the latest security updates.
   - Affected user accounts' credentials were reset.
   - Systems were closely monitored for signs of persistent threats.

5. Post-Incident Activity:
   - A thorough investigation was conducted to understand the scope of the breach.
   - A security audit was performed to ensure no backdoors were left by the attackers.
   - All system logs were reviewed for any signs of lateral movement or additional compromise.

--------------------------------------
LESSONS LEARNED:

- The importance of keeping software up to date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
- The need for regular vulnerability scans and prompt remediation of identified issues.
- The effectiveness of an incident response plan and the need for regular testing and updates to the plan.

--------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Implement a strict patch management policy to ensure all systems and applications are running the latest versions.
- Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to recognize and report potential security threats.
- Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to incidents more rapidly.
- Review and update the incident response plan to incorporate lessons learned from this test.
